<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For there might be a poetry which would be the hymn of divine perfection, the harmony of goodness and truth among men: a strain which should renew the youth of the world, and bring back the ages in which the poet was man's only teacher and best friend,&mdash;which would find materials in the living present as well as in the romance of the past, and might subdue to the fairest forms of speech and verse the intractable materials of modern civilisation,&mdash;which might elicit the simple principles, or, as Plato would have called them, the essential forms, of truth and justice out of the variety of opinion and the complexity of modern society,&mdash;which would preserve all the good of each generation and leave the bad unsung,&mdash;which should be based not on vain longings or faint imaginings, but on a clear insight into the nature of man.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Reason teaches us this; for if we suppose a change in God, he must be changed either by another or by himself. By another?&mdash;but the best works of nature and art and the noblest qualities of mind are least liable to be changed by any external force. By himself?&mdash;but he cannot change for the better; he will hardly change for the worse. He remains for ever fairest and best in his own image. Therefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell us of Here begging in the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl about at night in strange disguises; all that blasphemous nonsense with which mothers fool the manhood out of their children must be suppressed. But some one will say that God, who is himself unchangeable, may take a form in relation to us.</p></div> </div>

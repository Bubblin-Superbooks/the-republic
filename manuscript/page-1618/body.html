<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Well, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?</p><p>Yes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now passing in review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.</p><p>But does any of these dissolve or destroy her?&mdash;and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when he is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil of the soul. Take the analogy of the body: The evil of the body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body; and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them. Is not this true?</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>sciences, as they are often termed, although they require some other name, implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science, and this in our previous sketch was understanding. And so we get four names&mdash;two for intellect, and two for opinion,&mdash;reason or mind, understanding, faith, perception of shadows&mdash;which make a proportion&mdash; being:becoming::intellect:opinion&mdash;and science:belief::understanding: perception of shadows. Dialectic may be further described as that science which defines and explains the essence or being of each nature, which distinguishes and abstracts the good, and is ready to do battle against all opponents in the cause of good. To him who is not a dialectician life is but a sleepy dream; and many a man is in his grave before his is well waked up.</p></div> </div>

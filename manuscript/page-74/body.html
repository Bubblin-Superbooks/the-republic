Imagine the unjust man to be master of his craft, seldom making mistakes and easily correcting them; having gifts of money, speech, strength&mdash;the greatest villain bearing the highest character: and at his side let us place the just in his nobleness and simplicity&mdash;being, not seeming&mdash;without name or reward&mdash;clothed in his justice only&mdash;the best of men who is thought to be the worst, and let him die as he has lived. I might add (but I would rather put the rest into the mouth of the panegyrists of injustice&mdash;they will tell you) that the just man will be scourged, racked, bound, will have his eyes put out, and will at last be crucified</p></div> </div>

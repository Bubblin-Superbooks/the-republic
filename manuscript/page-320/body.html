<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> At the commencement of Book VII, under the figure of a cave having an opening towards a fire and a way upwards to the true light, he returns to view the divisions of knowledge, exhibiting familiarly, as in a picture, the result which had been hardly won by a great effort of thought in the previous discussion; at the same time casting a glance onward at the dialectical process, which is represented by the way leading from darkness to light. The shadows, the images, the reflection of the sun and stars in the water, the stars and sun themselves, severally correspond,&mdash;the first, to the realm of fancy and poetry,&mdash;the second, to the world of sense,&mdash;the third, to the abstractions or universals of sense, of which the mathematical sciences furnish the type,&mdash;the fourth and last to the same abstractions, when seen in the unity of the idea, from which they derive a new meaning and power.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The base of the number with a fourth added (or which is 3:4), multiplied by five and cubed, gives two harmonies:&mdash;the first a square number, which is a hundred times the base (or a hundred times a hundred); the second, an oblong, being a hundred squares of the rational diameter of a figure the side of which is five, subtracting one from each square or two perfect squares from all, and adding a hundred cubes of three. This entire number is geometrical and contains the rule or law of generation. When this law is neglected marriages will be unpropitious; the inferior offspring who are then born will in time become the rulers; the State will decline, and education fall into decay; gymnastic will be preferred to music, and the gold and silver and brass and iron will form a chaotic mass&mdash;thus division will arise. Such is the Muses' answer to our question.</p></div> </div>

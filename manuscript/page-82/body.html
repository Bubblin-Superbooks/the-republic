The heroes of Musaeus and Eumolpus lie on couches at a festival, with garlands on their heads, enjoying as the meed of virtue a paradise of immortal drunkenness. Some go further, and speak of a fair posterity in the third and fourth generation. But the wicked they bury in a slough and make them carry water in a sieve: and in this life they attribute to them the infamy which Glaucon was assuming to be the lot of the just who are supposed to be unjust.</p><p>'Take another kind of argument which is found both in poetry and prose:&mdash;"Virtue," as Hesiod says, "is honourable but difficult, vice is easy and profitable."

Then you must train them in dialectic, which will teach them to ask and answer questions, and is the coping-stone of the sciences.</p><p>I dare say that you have not forgotten how our rulers were chosen; and the process of selection may be carried a step further:&mdash;As before, they must be constant and valiant, good-looking, and of noble manners, but now they must also have natural ability which education will improve; that is to say, they must be quick at learning, capable of mental toil, retentive, solid, diligent natures, who combine intellectual with moral virtues; not lame and one-sided, diligent in bodily exercise and indolent in mind, or conversely; not a maimed soul, which hates falsehood and yet unintentionally is always wallowing in the mire of ignorance;</p></div> </div>

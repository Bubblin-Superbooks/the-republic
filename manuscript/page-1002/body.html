In a word, there is no excuse which you will not make, and nothing which you will not say, in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the spring-time of youth.</p><p>If you make me an authority in matters of love, for the sake of the argument, I assent.</p><p>And what do you say of lovers of wine? Do you not see them doing the same? They are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.</p><p>Very good.</p></div> </div>

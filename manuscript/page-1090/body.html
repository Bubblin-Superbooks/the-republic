<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And was I not right, Adeimantus?</p><p>Yes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like everything else, requires to be explained; for community may be of many kinds. Please, therefore, to say what sort of community you mean. We have been long expecting that you would tell us something about the family life of your citizens&mdash;how they will bring children into the world, and rear them when they have arrived, and, in general, what is the nature of this community of women and children&mdash;for we are of opinion that the right or wrong management of such matters will have a great and paramount influence on the State for good or for evil. And now, since the question is still undetermined, and you are taking in hand another State, we have resolved, as you heard, not to let you go until you give an account of all this.</p></div> </div>

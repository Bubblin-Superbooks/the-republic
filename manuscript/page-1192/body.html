<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And knowledge is relative to being and knows being. But before I proceed further I will make a division.</p><p>What division?</p><p>I will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are powers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. Sight and hearing, for example, I should call faculties. Have I clearly explained the class which I mean?</p><p>Yes, I quite understand.</p><p>Then let me tell you my view about them. I do not see them, and therefore the distinctions of figure, colour, and the like, which enable me to discern the differences of some things, do not apply to them. In speaking of a faculty I think only of its sphere and its result; and that which has the same sphere and the same result I call the same faculty, but that which has another sphere and another result I call different. Would that be your way of speaking?</p></div> </div>

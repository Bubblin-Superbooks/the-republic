The only qualification which she demands is the profession of patriotism. Such is democracy;&mdash;a pleasing, lawless, various sort of government, distributing equality to equals and unequals alike.</p><p>Let us now inspect the individual democrat; and first, as in the case of the State, we will trace his antecedents. He is the son of a miserly oligarch, and has been taught by him to restrain the love of unnecessary pleasures. Perhaps I ought to explain this latter term:&mdash;Necessary pleasures are those which are good, and which we cannot do without; unnecessary pleasures are those which do no good, and of which the desire might be eradicated by early training.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Beyond question.</p><p>And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>And the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?</p><p>Very true.</p><p>And, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in warbling and the delights of song; in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made useful, instead of brittle and useless. But, if he carries on the softening and soothing process, in the next stage he begins to melt and waste, until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul; and he becomes a feeble warrior.</p></div> </div>

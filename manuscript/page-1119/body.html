<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, and then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold, but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering after their own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they will be fighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole State.</p><p>Most true, he replied.</p><p>And the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition is that of true philosophy. Do you know of any other?</p><p>Indeed, I do not, he said.</p></div> </div>

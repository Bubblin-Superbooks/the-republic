<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">not divided into hes and shes&mdash;we do not take the masculine gender out to hunt and leave the females at home to look after their puppies. They have the same employments&mdash;the only difference between them is that the one sex is stronger and the other weaker. But if women are to have the same employments as men, they must have the same education&mdash;they must be taught music and gymnastics, and the art of war. I know that a great joke will be made of their riding on horseback and carrying weapons; the sight of the naked old wrinkled women showing their agility in the palaestra will certainly not be a vision of beauty, and may be expected to become a famous jest. But we must not mind the wits; there was a time when they might have laughed at our present gymnastics. All is habit: people have at last found out that the exposure is better than the concealment of the person, and now they laugh no more. Evil only should be the subject of ridicule.</p></div> </div>

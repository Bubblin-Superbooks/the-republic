<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what is it?&mdash;to speak the truth and to pay your debts&mdash;no more than this? And even to this are there not exceptions? Suppose that a friend when in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him? No one would say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so, any more than they would say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his condition.</p><p>You are quite right, he replied.</p><p>But then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a correct definition of justice.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The relation of the two works to one another is very well given:</p><p>(1) by Aristotle in the Politics from the side of the Laws:&mdash;</p><p>'The same, or nearly the same, objections apply to Plato's later work, the Laws, and therefore we had better examine briefly the constitution which is therein described. In the Republic, Socrates has definitely settled in all a few questions only; such as the community of women and children, the community of property, and the constitution of the state. The population is divided into two classes&mdash;one of husbandmen, and the other of warriors; from this latter is taken a third class of counsellors and rulers of the state. But Socrates has not determined whether the husbandmen and artists are to have a share in the government, and whether they too are to carry arms and share in military service or not.</p></div> </div>

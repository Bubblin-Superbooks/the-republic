Which of us has spoken truly? And which sort of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?</p><p>I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous, he answered.</p><p>Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus was rehearsing?</p><p>Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.</p><p>Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that he is saying what is not true?</p></div> </div>

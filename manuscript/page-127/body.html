<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Either these so-called sons of gods were not the sons of gods, or they were not such as the poets imagine them, any more than the gods themselves are the authors of evil. The youth who believes that such things are done by those who have the blood of heaven flowing in their veins will be too ready to imitate their example.</p><p>Enough of gods and heroes;&mdash;what shall we say about men? What the poets and story-tellers say&mdash;that the wicked prosper and the righteous are afflicted, or that justice is another's gain? Such misrepresentations cannot be allowed by us. But in this we are anticipating the definition of justice, and had therefore better defer the enquiry.</p></div> </div>

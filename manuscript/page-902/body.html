Thus he spoke, and the other Greeks revered the priest and assented. But Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him depart and not come again, lest the staff and chaplets of the God should be of no avail to him&mdash;the daughter of Chryses should not be released, he said&mdash;she should grow old with him in Argos.

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For you fancy that shepherds and rulers never think of their own interest, but only of their sheep or subjects, whereas the truth is that they fatten them for their use, sheep and subjects alike. And experience proves that in every relation of life the just man is the loser and the unjust the gainer, especially where injustice is on the grand scale, which is quite another thing from the petty rogueries of swindlers and burglars and robbers of temples. The language of men proves this&mdash;our 'gracious' and 'blessed' tyrant and the like&mdash;all which tends to show (1) that justice is the interest of the stronger; and (2) that injustice is more profitable and also stronger than justice.'</p><p>Thrasymachus, who is better at a speech than at a close argument, having deluged the company with words, has a mind to escape.</p></div> </div>

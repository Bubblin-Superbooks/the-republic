And therefore you had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing to argue. You will very likely say with neither, and that your chief aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement; at the same time you do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive.</p><p>I think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own behalf.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>custom and ignorance; now that criticism has pierced the veil of tradition and the past no longer overpowers the present,&mdash;the progress of civilization may be expected to be far greater and swifter than heretofore. Even at our present rate of speed the point at which we may arrive in two or three generations is beyond the power of imagination to foresee. There are forces in the world which work, not in an arithmetical, but in a geometrical ratio of increase. Education, to use the expression of Plato, moves like a wheel with an ever-multiplying rapidity. Nor can we say how great may be its influence, when it becomes universal,&mdash;when it has been inherited by many generations,&mdash;when it is freed from the trammels of superstition and rightly adapted to the wants and capacities of different classes of men and women.</p></div> </div>

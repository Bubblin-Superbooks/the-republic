<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such men in their early days live with flatterers, and they themselves flatter others, in order to gain their ends; but they soon discard their followers when they have no longer any need of them; they are always either masters or servants,&mdash;the joys of friendship are unknown to them. And they are utterly treacherous and unjust, if the nature of justice be at all understood by us. They realize our dream; and he who is the most of a tyrant by nature, and leads the life of a tyrant for the longest time, will be the worst of them, and being the worst of them, will also be the most miserable.</p><p>Like man, like State,&mdash;the tyrannical man will answer to tyranny, which is the extreme opposite of the royal State; for one is the best and the other the worst.</p></div> </div>

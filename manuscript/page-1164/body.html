<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">let me remind you that, although in our former selection we chose old men, we must not do so in this. Solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he grows old may learn many things&mdash;for he can no more learn much than he can run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary toil.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>And, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements of instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented to the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our system of education.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge of any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind.</p></div> </div>

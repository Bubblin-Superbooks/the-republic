Just as in the Jewish prophets the reign of Messiah, or 'the day of the Lord,' or the suffering Servant or people of God, or the 'Sun of righteousness with healing in his wings' only convey, to us at least, their great spiritual ideals, so through the Greek State Plato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection, which is the idea of good&mdash;like the sun in the visible world;&mdash;about human perfection, which is justice&mdash;about education beginning in youth and continuing in later years&mdash;about poets and sophists and tyrants who are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind&mdash;about 'the world' which is the embodiment of them&mdash;about a kingdom</p></div> </div>

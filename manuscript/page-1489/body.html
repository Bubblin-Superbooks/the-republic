<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Very true, I said; and observe the point which I want to understand: Certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be unlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are controlled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail over them&mdash;either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak; while in the case of others they are stronger, and there are more of them.</p><p>Which appetites do you mean?</p><p>I mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or drink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy his desires; and there is no conceivable folly or crime&mdash;not excepting incest or any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of forbidden food&mdash;</p></div> </div>

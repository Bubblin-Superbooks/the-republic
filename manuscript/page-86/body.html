<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This is what I want you to show, Socrates;&mdash;other men use arguments which rather tend to strengthen the position of Thrasymachus that "might is right;" but from you I expect better things. And please, as Glaucon said, to exclude reputation; let the just be thought unjust and the unjust just, and do you still prove to us the superiority of justice'...</p><p>The thesis, which for the sake of argument has been maintained by Glaucon, is the converse of that of Thrasymachus&mdash;not right is the interest of the stronger, but right is the necessity of the weaker. Starting from the same premises he carries the analysis of society a step further back;&mdash;might is still right, but the might is the weakness of the many combined against the strength of the few.</p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The giving of the lots, the weaving of them, and the making of them irreversible, which are ascribed to the three Fates&mdash;Lachesis, Clotho, Atropos, are obviously derived from their names. The element of chance in human life is indicated by the order of the lots. But chance, however adverse, may be overcome by the wisdom of man, if he knows how to choose aright; there is a worse enemy to man than chance; this enemy is himself. He who was moderately fortunate in the number of the lot&mdash;even the very last comer&mdash;might have a good life if he chose with wisdom. And as Plato does not like to make an assertion which is unproven, he more than confirms this statement a few sentences afterwards by the example of Odysseus, who chose last.</p></div> </div>

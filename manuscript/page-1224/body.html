The pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by him&mdash;that is not the order of nature; neither are 'the wise to go to the doors of the rich'&mdash;the ingenious author of this saying told a lie&mdash;but the truth is, that, when a man is ill, whether he be rich or poor, to the physician he must go, and he who wants to be governed, to him who is able to govern. The ruler who is good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him; although the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp; they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors, and the true helmsmen to those who are called by them good-for-nothings and star-gazers.</p></div> </div>
